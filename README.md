# Analyse It: News Research Tool ðŸ“Š

## Overview

"Analyse It" is a powerful chatbot designed to assist business analysts and decision-makers by quickly extracting relevant insights from large articles. By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this tool simplifies the process of finding answers, enabling quicker and more informed decision-making.

## Features

- **Streamlined Article Analysis**: Processes up to three article URLs at a time for efficient data retrieval.
- **Question Answering**: Extracts precise answers from large articles using advanced embeddings and language models.
- **Source Attribution**: Displays sources for answers to ensure transparency and reliability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Input Article URLs**: Users provide up to three URLs of news articles via the sidebar.

2. **Data Processing**:
    - Articles are loaded and split into smaller chunks using a recursive text splitter.
    - Embeddings are generated for each chunk using the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
    - These embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for efficient retrieval.

3. **Ask Questions**:
    - Users input their query.
    - The tool retrieves relevant chunks and uses Google Generative AI (model: "gemini-1.5-flash") to generate an accurate response.

4. **Display Results**:
    - Provides the answer and lists the sources for the response.

## Tech Stack
